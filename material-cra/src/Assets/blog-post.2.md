# Overview

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. 

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.

The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.

# Signs and Symptoms

People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms.

## Possible symptoms include:

* Fever or chills
* Cough
* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
* Fatigue
* Muscle or body aches
* Headache
* New loss of taste or smell
* Sore throat
* Congestion or runny nose
* Nausea or vomiting
* Diarrhea

This list does not include all possible symptoms. Symptoms may change with new COVID-19 variants and can vary depending on vaccination status. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. Older adults and people who have underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19.


# How It Spreads

Mpox can spread to anyone through close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact, including:

* Direct contact with mpox rash and scabs from a person with mpox, as well as contact with their saliva, upper respiratory secretions (snot, mucus), and areas around the anus, rectum, or vagina

This direct contact can happen during intimate contact, including:

* Oral, anal, or vaginal sex, or touching the genitals (penis, testicles, labia, and vagina) or anus of a person with mpox
* Hugging, massage, and kissing
* Prolonged face-to-face contact

The risk is considered low for getting mpox by touching objects, fabrics, and surfaces that have been used by someone with mpox and not disinfected, such as clothing, bedding, towels etc.


# Testing

## When you get tested:
* Make sure to test at the right time
* Choose the right type of test for your circumstance
* Follow test directions as recommended by FDA
If you do not, your results may be less likely to correctly indicate whether you have COVID-19 or not.

## Types of Tests
Viral tests look for a current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by testing specimens from your nose or mouth. All tests should be performed following FDA’s requirements.

There are two main types of viral tests:

* Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests
* Antigen tests

## PCR Tests

PCR tests are the “gold standard” for COVID-19 tests. They are a type of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), which are more likely to detect the virus than antigen tests. Your sample will usually be taken by a healthcare provider and transported to a laboratory for testing. It may take up to 3 days to receive results.

## Antigen Tests
rapid antigen tests
Antigen tests* are rapid tests that usually produce results in 15-30 minutes. Positive results are very accurate and reliable. However, in general, antigen tests are less likely to detect the virus than PCR tests, especially when symptoms are not present. Therefore, a single negative antigen test cannot rule out infection. To be confident you do not have COVID-19, FDA recommends 2 negative antigen tests for individuals with symptoms or 3 antigen tests for those without symptoms, performed 48 hours apart. A single PCR test can be used to confirm an antigen test result.

** Self-tests, or at-home tests, are antigen tests that can be taken anywhere without having to go to a specific testing site. Read self-test package inserts thoroughly and follow the instructions closely when performing the test. **

## When to Get Tested for COVID-19

If you have symptoms, test immediately.
* If you are only going to take a single test, a PCR test will provide a more reliable negative test result.
* If you use an antigen test, a positive result is reliable, but a negative test is not always accurate.
*  If your antigen test is negative, take another antigen test after 48 hours or take a PCR test as soon as you can.

If you do not have symptoms but have been exposed to COVID-19, wait at least 5 full days after your exposure before taking a test.
* If you are only going to take a single test, a PCR test will provide a more reliable negative test result.
* If you use an antigen test, a positive result is reliable, but a negative test is not always accurate.
* If your antigen test is negative, take another antigen test after 48 hours or take a PCR test as soon as you can.
* If your second antigen test is also negative, wait another 48 hours and test a third time.

# Preventions
In addition to basic health and hygiene practices, like handwashing, It is recommended some prevention actions at all COVID-19 hospital admission levels, which include:

* Staying Up to Date with COVID-19 Vaccines
* Improving Ventilation
* Getting Tested for COVID-19 If Needed
* Staying Home If You Have Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19
* Seeking Treatment If You Have COVID-19 and Are at High Risk of Getting Very Sick
* Avoiding Contact with People Who Have Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19

# Vaccines
COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are effective at protecting people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, and dying. As with other vaccine-preventable diseases, you are best protected best from COVID-19 when you stay up to date with the recommended vaccinations.

Four COVID-19 vaccines are approved or authorized in the United States:

* Pfizer-BioNTech
* Moderna
* Novavax
* Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen

## Pfizer-BioNTech
* Everyone aged 6 years and older should get 1 updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to be up to date.
* People aged 65 years and older may get a 2nd dose of updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.
* People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may get additional doses of updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.
* Children aged 6 months–5 years may need multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccine to be up to date, including at least 1 dose of updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, depending on the number of doses they’ve previously received and their age.

## Moderna
Children aged 6 months–4 years who got the original Moderna COVID-19 vaccine
Children aged 6 months—4 years who got:

* 2 doses of the original Moderna COVID-19 vaccine should get 1 updated Moderna vaccine.

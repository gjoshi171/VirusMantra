# Overview

Ebola virus disease (EVD or Ebola) is a rare but severe illness in humans. It is often fatal.

People get infected with Ebola by touching:

* infected animals when preparing, cooking or eating them
* body fluids of an infected person such as saliva, urine, faeces or semen
* things that have the body fluids of an infected person like clothes or sheets.
* Ebola enters the body through cuts in the skin or when touching one’s eyes, nose or mouth.

Early symptoms include fever, fatigue and headache.

Some types of Ebola can be prevented with vaccines and treated with medicines.

Ebola first appeared in 1976 in 2 simultaneous outbreaks, one in what is now Nzara, South Sudan, and the other in Yambuku, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.

The virus family Filoviridae includes 3 genera: Cuevavirus, Marburgvirus, and Ebolavirus. Within the genus Ebolavirus, 6 species have been identified: Zaire, Bundibugyo, Sudan, Taï Forest, Reston and Bombali.


# Signs and Symptoms

Symptoms may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after contact with an ebolavirus, with an average of 8 to 10 days. The course of the illness typically progresses from “dry” symptoms initially (such as fever, aches and pains, and fatigue), and then progresses to “wet” symptoms (such as diarrhea and vomiting) as the person becomes sicker.

Primary signs and symptoms of Ebola disease often include some or several of the following:

* Fever
* Aches and pains, such as severe headache and muscle and joint pain
* Weakness and fatigue
* Sore throat
* Loss of appetite
* Gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting
* Unexplained hemorrhaging, bleeding or bruising
Other symptoms may include red eyes, skin rash, and hiccups.

Many common illnesses can have the same symptoms as Ebola disease, including influenza (flu), malaria, or typhoid fever.

Ebola disease is a rare and often deadly illness. Recovery depends on good supportive clinical care and the patient’s immune response. Studies show that survivors of an ebolavirus infection have antibodies (proteins made by the immune system that identify and neutralize invading viruses) that can be detected in the blood up to 10 years after recovery. Survivors are thought to have some protective immunity to the species of ebolavirus that sickened them.


# How It Spreads

Scientists think people are initially infected with an ebolavirus through contact with an infected animal, such as a fruit bat or nonhuman primate. This is called a spillover event. After that, the virus spreads from person to person, potentially affecting many people.

Ebolaviruses spread through contact (such as through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth) with:

* Blood or body fluids (urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, amniotic fluid, and semen) of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola disease.
* Objects (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment) contaminated with body fluids from a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola disease.
* Infected fruit bats or nonhuman primates (such as apes and monkeys).

When people become infected with an ebolavirus, they do not start developing signs or symptoms right away. This period between exposure to an illness and having symptoms is known as the incubation period. A person can only spread an ebolavirus to other people after they develop signs and symptoms of Ebola disease.

Additionally, ebolaviruses are not known to be transmitted through food. However, in certain parts of the world, ebolaviruses may spread through the handling and consumption of wild animal meat or hunted wild animals infected with an ebolavirus. There is no evidence that mosquitoes or other insects can transmit ebolaviruses.


# Laboratory Procedures and Testing

## Specimen collection and testing
* Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when collecting clinical specimens from suspect or confirmed cases. Depending on the patient’s stage of illness, refer to PPE guidance for healthcare workers during management of clinically stable or clinically unstable patients with suspect or confirmed Ebola disease.
* For adults, collect two 4 mL tubes of whole blood in a plastic tube preserved with EDTA. For pediatric patients, collect a minimum of 1 mL whole blood in a pediatric-sized collection tube preserved with EDTA.
Do not transport or ship specimens in glass containers or in heparinized tubes.
* If the specimen test result is negative and the patient’s symptoms have been present for less than three days, a second sample should be collected 72 hours after symptoms and in consultation with public health officials.


# Preventions
In the areas where Ebola disease is most common, ebolaviruses are believed to spread at low rates among certain animal populations. Ebolaviruses can spread to a person when they come in contact with an infected animal. Once infected, a person can become sick with Ebola disease and spread the virus to other people who come in contact with them.

When living in or traveling to a region where ebolaviruses are potentially present, there are several ways to protect yourself and prevent the spread of Ebola disease.

* Avoid contact with blood and body fluids (such as urine, feces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, amniotic fluid, semen, and vaginal fluids) of people who are sick.
* Avoid contact with semen from a man who has recovered from Ebola disease, until testing shows that the virus is gone from his semen.
* Avoid contact with items that may have come in contact with an infected person’s blood or body fluids (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).
* Avoid funeral or burial practices that involve touching the body of someone who is suspected or confirmed to have had Ebola disease.
* Avoid contact with bats, forest antelopes, nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and chimpanzees), and the blood, fluids, or raw meat prepared from these or unknown animals.
These same prevention methods should be used when living in or traveling to an area affected by an Ebola outbreak. After returning from an Ebola-affected area, people should monitor their health for 21 days and seek medical care immediately if they develop symptoms of Ebola disease.

# Vaccines

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Ebola vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV (called Ervebo®) on December 19, 2019. This vaccine is given as a single dose vaccine and has been found to be safe and protective against Ebola virus (species Zaire ebolavirus) only, which has caused the largest and most deadly Ebola outbreaks to date. This is the first FDA-approved vaccine for an ebolavirus.

# Overview

Before the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, the influenza A(H1N1) virus had never been identified as a cause of infections in people. Genetic analyses of this virus have shown that it originated from animal influenza viruses and is unrelated to the human seasonal H1N1 viruses that have been in general circulation among people since 1977.

After early reports of influenza outbreaks in North America in April 2009, the new influenza virus spread rapidly around the world. By the time WHO declared a pandemic in June 2009, a total of 74 countries and territories had reported laboratory confirmed infections. Unlike typical seasonal flu patterns, the new virus caused high levels of summer infections in the northern hemisphere, and then even higher levels of activity during cooler months. The new virus also led to patterns of death and illness not normally seen in influenza infections.

The H1N1 (2009) virus continues to circulate as a seasonal virus and is included in the vaccines against seasonal influenza. 

# Signs and Symptoms

## Frequent Symptoms
Like other seasonal flu viruses, common symptoms of swine flu (H1N1) develop between one and three days after you've been infected and can include:

* Fever, which is usually high, but is sometimes absent
* Cough
* Runny or stuffy nose
* Sore throat
* Body aches
* Headache
* Chills
* Fatigue or tiredness, which can be extreme
* Diarrhea and vomiting occasionally, but more commonly seen than with other strains of flu

## Serious Symptoms

Serious symptoms are rarer. In children, they can include:
* Fast breathing or difficulty breathing
* Bluish or gray skin color
* Not drinking enough fluids
* Severe or persistent vomiting
* Not waking up or not interacting
* Irritability so great that your child does not want to be held
* Flu-like symptoms get better but then come back with fever and worse cough
* Rash with a fever

In adults, serious symptoms include:
* Difficulty breathing
* Chest pain or pressure
* Abdominal pain or pressure
* Dizziness
* Confusion
* Vomiting that's severe or won't stop
* Flu-like symptoms get better but then come back with fever and worse cough


# Prevention

* Anyone who is at higher risk of serious flu complications planning to attend an event or setting where pigs will be present, such as an agricultural fair, should avoid pigs and swine barns.
* If people at higher risk cannot avoid exposure to pigs, they should wear a well-fitting mask that covers the nose and mouth to reduce the risk of exposure to flu viruses from pigs.
* They should also wash their hands with soap and running water before and after exposure to pigs or a swine barn. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
* People who are at higher risk of serious flu complications include children younger than 5 years, people 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain long-term health conditions (like asthma and other lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions).

# Overview

The monkeypox virus is an orthopoxvirus that causes mpox (monkeypox), a disease with symptoms similar to smallpox, although less severe. While smallpox was eradicated in 1980, mpox continues to occur in countries of central and west Africa. Since May 2022, cases have also been reported from countries without previously documented mpox transmission outside the African region. Two distinct clades of the monkeypox virus have been identified: Clade I (previously known as the Congo Basin (central African) clade and Clade II (the former west African clade).

Mpox is a zoonosis, a disease that is transmitted from animals to humans, with cases often found close to tropical rainforests where there are animals that carry the virus. Evidence of monkeypox virus infection has been found in animals including squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, different species of monkeys and others. 

The disease can also spread from humans to humans. It can be transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, lesions on the skin or on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth or throat, respiratory droplets and contaminated objects. 

# Signs and Symptoms

People with mpox often get a rash that may be located on hands, feet, chest, face, or mouth or near the genitals, including penis, testicles, labia, and vagina, and anus.  The incubation period is 3-17 days. During this time, a person does not have symptoms and may feel fine.

* The rash will go through several stages, including scabs, before healing.
* The rash can initially look like pimples or blisters and may be painful or itchy.

## Other symptoms of mpox can include:

* Fever
* Chills
* Swollen lymph nodes
* Exhaustion
* Muscle aches and backache
* Headache
* Respiratory symptoms (e.g., sore throat, nasal congestion, or cough)

## You may experience all or only a few symptoms

* Sometimes, people have flu-like symptoms before the rash.
* Some people get a rash first, followed by other symptoms.
* Others only experience a rash.

# How It Spreads

Mpox can spread to anyone through close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact, including:

* Direct contact with mpox rash and scabs from a person with mpox, as well as contact with their saliva, upper respiratory secretions (snot, mucus), and areas around the anus, rectum, or vagina

This direct contact can happen during intimate contact, including:

* Oral, anal, or vaginal sex, or touching the genitals (penis, testicles, labia, and vagina) or anus of a person with mpox
* Hugging, massage, and kissing
* Prolonged face-to-face contact

The risk is considered low for getting mpox by touching objects, fabrics, and surfaces that have been used by someone with mpox and not disinfected, such as clothing, bedding, towels etc.


# Testing

## When to Get Tested
* Currently, testing is only recommended if you have a rash consistent with mpox.
* If you think you have mpox or have had close personal contact with someone who has mpox, consider taking precautions and visit a healthcare provider to help you decide if you need to be tested for mpox.

## Where to Get Tested
* Only a healthcare provider can order an mpox test. The healthcare provider may take a specimen and send it to a lab for testing or they may send you to a lab for both specimen collection and testing.
* Contact your local health department with any questions and to find out what the testing options are for your community.

## What to Expect When You Get Tested
* You will likely need to fill out paperwork before you get tested.
* To get a specimen to test, the healthcare provider will use a swab to rub vigorously across lesions of your rash. They will take swabs from more than one lesion.
* This swabbing may be uncomfortable but is necessary to get enough material to detect the mpox virus from the specimens.
* The specimens will be tested in a lab to see if the mpox virus is detected.
* Results are usually available within a few days.
* While you are waiting for your results, take precautions to avoid getting or spreading mpox virus to others.

## What Your Results Mean
* If your test result is positive, take the necessary steps to protect yourself and others until you have completely recovered from your infection.
* If your test result is negative: a negative test result means the test did not detect the virus and you probably do not have mpox. Continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
* If your test result is inconclusive: that means that your test will need to be conducted again because not enough of the specimen was taken.

# Preventions
* Avoid close, skin-to-skin contact with people who have a rash that looks like mpox.
* Avoid contact with objects and materials that a person with mpox has used.
* Wash your hands often.   
* Get vaccinated!
* If you are in Central or West Africa, avoid contact with animals that can spread mpox virus, usually rodents and primates.

# Vaccines
Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) is caused by a virus that is related to the virus that causes smallpox. JYNNEOS is a 2-dose vaccine developed to protect against mpox and smallpox infections. People need to get both doses of the vaccine for the best protection against mpox. The second dose should be given 4 weeks after the first dose.

Vaccination is an important tool in stopping the spread of mpox. People who are vaccinated should continue to avoid close, skin-to-skin contact with someone who has mpox.

# Laboratory Procedures and Testing
Measures should be taken to minimize the risk of laboratory transmission when testing routine clinical specimens from confirmed or suspected mpox patients. These may include limiting the number of staff testing specimens, avoiding any procedures that could generate infectious aerosols, and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment while taking other precautions consistent with adherence to Standard Precautions.

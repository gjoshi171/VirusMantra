# Overview

Poliomyelitis (polio) is a highly infectious viral disease that largely affects children under 5 years of age. The virus is transmitted by person-to-person spread mainly through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (e.g. contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis.


# Signs and Symptoms

Most people who get infected with poliovirus will not have any visible symptoms.

About 1 out of 4 people (or 25 out of 100) with poliovirus infection will have flu-like symptoms that can include:
* Sore throat
* Fever
* Tiredness
* Nausea
* Headache
* Stomach pain

These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days, then go away on their own.

A smaller proportion of people with poliovirus infection will develop other, more serious symptoms that affect the brain and spinal cord:
* Meningitis (infection of the covering of the spinal cord and/or brain)occurs in about 1–5 out of 100 people with poliovirus infection, depending on virus type
* Paralysis (can’t move parts of the body) or weakness in the arms, legs, or both occurs in about 1 out of 200 people to 1 in 2000 people, depending on virus type

Paralysis is the most severe symptom associated with poliovirus because it can lead to permanent disability and death. Between 2 and 10 out of 100 people who have paralysis from poliovirus infection die, because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe.

Even children who seem to fully recover can develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults, 15 to 40 years later. This is called post-polio syndrome.


# How It Spreads

**Fecal-Oral Route:** The poliovirus is present in the feces (stool) of an infected person. If someone comes into contact with infected feces and then touches their mouth, the virus can enter their body. This can happen through poor hand hygiene, contaminated food, water, or objects.

**Contaminated Water:** Polio can spread through water that has been contaminated with infected fecal matter. Drinking water from contaminated sources or using such water for cooking or washing can lead to the transmission of the virus.

**Close Contact:** The poliovirus can spread through respiratory droplets expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets contain the virus and can be inhaled by others in close proximity to the infected person.

**Oral-oral Transmission:** The virus can also be transmitted through direct contact with oral secretions, such as saliva. This can occur when infected individuals kiss, share utensils, or engage in other activities that involve close contact with the mouth.

**Contaminated Surfaces:** The poliovirus can survive on surfaces for a period of time. If a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches their mouth, they can introduce the virus into their body.


# Testing

## Virus Isolation and Detection
Virus isolation in culture is the most sensitive method to diagnose poliovirus infection. Poliovirus is most likely to be isolated from stool specimens. It may also be isolated from pharyngeal swabs. Isolation is less likely from blood or CSF.

To increase the probability of isolating poliovirus, collect at least two stool specimens 24 hours apart from patients with suspected poliomyelitis. These should be collected as early in the course of disease as possible (ideally within 14 days after onset).

Real-time reverse transcription PCR is used to differentiate possible wild strains from vaccine-like strains (“intratypic differentiation”), using virus isolated in culture as the starting material.

Partial genome sequencing is used to confirm the poliovirus genotype and determine its likely geographic origin.

## Serologic Testing
Serology may be helpful in supporting the diagnosis of paralytic poliomyelitis, particularly if a patient is known or suspected to not be vaccinated. An acute serum specimen should be obtained as early in the course of disease as possible, and a convalescent specimen should be obtained at least 3 weeks later.

## Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis
Detection of poliovirus in CSF is uncommon. CSF usually contains an increased number of leukocytes [from 10 to 200 cells/mm3 (primarily lymphocytes)] and a mildly elevated protein (from 40 to 50 mg/dL). These findings are nonspecific and may result from a variety of infectious and noninfectious conditions.


# Preventions
In addition to basic health and hygiene practices, like handwashing, It is recommended some prevention actions at all COVID-19 hospital admission levels, which include:

* Staying Up to Date with COVID-19 Vaccines
* Improving Ventilation
* Getting Tested for COVID-19 If Needed
* Staying Home If You Have Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19
* Seeking Treatment If You Have COVID-19 and Are at High Risk of Getting Very Sick
* Avoiding Contact with People Who Have Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19


# Vaccines
There is no cure for polio, but it can be prevented with safe and effective vaccination. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is the only polio vaccine that has been given in the United States since 2000. It is given by shot in the arm or leg, depending on the person’s age. 

## Who Should Get Polio Vaccine?
**Infants and Children**
As part of routine childhood immunization, children in the United States should get inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to protect against polio, or poliomyelitis. They should get four doses total, with one dose at each of the following ages:

* 2 months old
* 4 months old
* 6 through 18 months old
* 4 through 6 years old
